He presented in 410 for a short stay unit admission with progressive lower extremity weakness bilaterally and urinary incontinence. It was felt at that time by neurosurgery and neurology to be multifactorial and no consistent with disk or cord impingement. There was a work up at that time including B12 , ANA and HIV all of which were negative. EMG showed decreased recruitment in the tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius bilaterally. His rectus femoris were normal bilaterally. He was treated for a urinary tract infection at that time with Bactrim for resolution of his incontinence and he was not anticoagulated by his primary care physician.

Pupils equal , round and reactive to light and accommodation. No conjunctivitis. Oropharynx is clear. Mucous membranes were moist. Jugular venous distention not appreciated. CHEST Clear to auscultation bilaterally. HEART IIVI systolic ejection murmur at the apex radiating to the axilla. Irregular , irregular rhythm. No S3 or S4. ABDOMEN Obese , soft and nontender. ABDOMEN Obese , soft and nontender. Nondistended with positive bowel sounds and a significant rash of his pannus. RECTAL Strong rectal tone. EXTREMITIES Right calf was with a shallow , erythematous dry ulcer which was chronic with changes consistent with venous insufficiency and varicose veins. NEUROLOGICAL Nonfocal. Strength in the right hip flexor was decreased to 45 and on the right his plantar dorsiflexion strength was 45 bilaterally. Sensation was grossly intact to touch. Finger-to-nose was normal. LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION Sodium 140 , potassium 4.5 , chloride 102 , bicarbonate 26 , BUN 20 , creatinine 0.9 , glucose 101.

His urinalysis showed 3+ blood and positive leukocyte esterase with 15-20 white blood cells , one plus bacteria and one plus squamous cells. HOSPITAL COURSE 1. Neurological The neurology service came by to see the patient in the Emergency Room and felt that there was no acute neurologic change but if the patient was unable to walk he should be sent to rehabilitation. They saw no new acute change and he should continue to be followed by neurology in clinic. 2. Cardiac He does have a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and echocardiogram with decreased ejection fraction was noted previously. He will be started on a trial of Lasix p.o. q day to decrease his peripheral edema to help him with rehabilitation and his primary care physician will continue to follow him for his atrial fibrillation and he does elect not to anticoagulate him at the moment though Coumadin should be a consideration given his risk of stroke. 3. Skin care Right calf demonstrates a pressure ulcer and the patient should apply Nystatin powder for his pannus rash. 4. Infectious disease His urinary tract infection will be treated with seven days of Bactrim and follow urine cultures.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION In the Emergency Department here at the Merso Ri Riska Hospital , her temperature was 101.5 , her heart rate was 128 , blood pressure 10352 , and she was breathing regularly , saturating 98 on room air. She was generally a mildly ill appearing obese female. Cardiovascularly , she was tachycardic and regular. She had a 26 systolic murmur louder on the right. Her lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Her abdomen was soft and obese , nontender , with audible but low bowel sounds. Rectal exam was trace guaiac-positive by report.

There was no labial or perirectal involvement. LABS ON ADMISSION BUN of 73 , creatinine of 3.8 , and a glucose of 357. White blood cell count of 18.4. EKG on admission showed sinus tachycardia , with some T wave inversion , and chest x-ray showed some mild pulmonary edema. The UA showed some trace blood and trace leukocyte esterase. HOSPITAL COURSE Patient was taken emergently to the operating room for an incision and drainage of this abscess , which was believed to be a necrotizing fasciitis. Postoperatively , the patient remained intubated and was in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit. She was started on NeoFed for control of her blood pressure to get it to the 70s , and was receiving metoprolol and esmolol for a heart rate that had gone up to the 130s. She was on triple antibiotics for full coverage and treatment of her infection. On postoperative day 1 , the patient remained in the Intensive Care Unit. She was awake and appeared comfortable on fentanyl for analgesia. She was evaluated by Brookstibu Health Cardiology. She continued to need Levophed for her blood pressure. Her cardiac enzymes and EKGs were being continuously followed for evaluation of cardiac complications. She continued to be on a ventilator and her diabetes was controlled with an insulin drip. On postoperative day 2 , Plastic Surgery was consulted and continued to follow the patient for future necessitating closure of this right thigh wound. On postoperative day 3 , patient remained in the Intensive Care Unit. Blood pressure was improving , NG tube was removed , and a diet was started. By postoperative day 4 , the patient was feeling well. She remained in the Intensive Care Unit. She was tolerating Percocet for pain. The wound appeared to have healthy tissue. She continued to necessitate an insulin drip. The cultures on the wound showed positive Enterococci and Corynebacter. She continued to be on vancomycin , levofloxacin , and Flagyl for these microbes. On postoperative day 4 , she was transferred to a regular nursing floor in stable condition. On the regular nursing floor , the patient continued to do well , tolerating all her diabetes meds by mouth. Her vital signs were stable , with blood pressures 14070s and a heart rate ranging in the 70-75s.

She was in stable condition. She was working with Physical Therapy. She was tolerating a regular diet and tolerating all of her medications , with continued stable vital signs. Her wound showed healthy tissue and was covered with a VAC sponge , that needs to be changed every three days. She continues to be on triple antibiotics , and on the day of discharge she is day 9 of a 21-day course. Her vancomycin is dosed daily , depending on her vancomycin level , that must be drawn also daily. Patient is to follow up with Dr. Malady in one week and is to follow up with Plastic Surgery in three weeks for evaluation of closure of the wound. Patient is to follow up with her primary care physician and her Princoness- Caken Valley Medical Center cardiologist as needed after discharge from rehab.

She had prior MI , last in 1991 and since then has been chest pain free. The day of admission , she had severe retrosternal chest pain ( as she reports , similar to her prior angina but not as severe ) and went to a local hospital. EKG and enzymes negative , but CXR showed widened mediastinum. There was concern for dissection , so she underwent CT which was read as positive for dissection in ascending aorta. She was transferred to ISCH CCU for further care. Repeat CT here showed no dissection but did show extensive calficiations and luminal disease of the aorta. She was chest pain free here until 524 AM when she had chest pain again with ST depressions in V3-V6 at rest. She was made pain free with nitro and heparin and transferred to the cardiology floor with presumed unstable angina given her anginal pain , EKG ischemia changes , but lack of elevated cardiac enzymes. Echo 1603 demonstrated EF 65 with no RWMA , no aortic root dissection , no effusion , and normal RV function. 1. CV On 51803 , cardiac catheterization was performed via radial approach which revealed 3 vessel coronary disease with 90 proximal LAD lesion followed by aneursymal segment and subsequent 90 lesion , diffuse non critical LAD disease distally , occluded and collateralized D1 , occluded and collateralized OM2 , anterior takeoff RCA with serial non-critical lesions and a mid 70 lesion. The LAD was stented with a 18mm X 2.5mm Cypher stent with good results. Patient will be continued on ASA , plavix , statin , metoprolol , and lisinopril will be started here ( nitrates will be discontinued ). Integrillin was also give pericatheterization for 16 hours. Fasting lipid profile on 87 revealed Triglycerides of 122 , HDL 28 ( low ) and normal cholesterol ( 122 ) , CLDL , VLDL 2. Renal Patient received mucomyst prior to the contrast CT here which was continued for her cardiac catheterization. Her renal function remained stable and normal throughout her hospital stay. 3. GU She has a history of recurrent UTIs and has been on bactrim prophylaxis here. Urine cultures on 524 and 420 have been negative. 4.
